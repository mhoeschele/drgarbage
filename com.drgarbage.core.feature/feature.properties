This assignment cannot be changed after the activation of the license.\n\nYou are responsible for the selection of SOFTWARE PRODUCT suitable for the achievement of your intended results, for the downloading, installation and use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\n\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless DR. GARBAGE against any claims arising out of any allegation that your use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT violates any laws, including, but not limited to copyright provisions.\n\n1.2 RUNTIME RIGHTS\: The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is built using Eclipse and related plug-ins, which are distributed under the following license. \n\nEclipse Public License (EPL) 1.0 available at http\://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html \n\nIT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ABOVE LICENSES PRIOR TO USE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. \n\n1.3 STORAGE/NETWORK USE. You may also store or install a copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a storage device, such as a network server, used only to install or run the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on your other computers over an internal network; however, you must acquire and dedicate a distinct license for each developer using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT from the storage device.\n\nAny given license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used concurrently or otherwise on different computers or by different developers in a given organization.\n\nThe SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single product.

Any supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.

GARBAGE as an upgrade, replaces and/or supplements the product that formed the basis for your eligibility for such upgrade.\n\nYou may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this EULA. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be used and transferred only as part of that single product package and may not be separated for use on more than one computer.\n\n4 COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT\n\n4.1 In consideration of the licenses granted by this EULA and the delivery of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT you agree to pay to DR.

You expressly acknowledge that it is not possible to develop computer and software products completely error free. Consequently, DR. GARBAGE's warranty is limited as set forth in the following provisions. \n\n6.2 INSPECTION AND REPORTING. Immediately upon receipt of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or upon completion of the download process, you are obliged to inspect the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as to errors and faults and report any detected error immediately to DR. GARBAGE. If you fail to report any error to DR. GARBAGE, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is deemed as accepted and error-free, unless the error was not recognizable at the time of your initial inspection. In case you take notice of such an error later on, you have to report it immediately upon detection to DR. GARBAGE. If you fail to report this error to DR. GARBAGE, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT shall be deemed accepted also with respect to such an error. \n\n6.3 DEADLINE. Any errors you have detected shall be reported to DR. GARBAGE by written mail or by e-mail. Your report has to include a detailed technical description of the error. The deadlines for such reporting are 48 hours upon receipt of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or upon completion of the download process (whichever is earlier), and in the case of initially unrecognizable errors 48 hours upon detection of the error, unless you prove that your compliance with such deadlines was not possible within you usual course of business. \n\n6.4 YOUR REMEDIES. In case of an error in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you have to give DR. GARBAGE a fair time period of at least two weeks for fixing the error by repair or replacement. DR. GARBAGE may deliver to you bug-fixes, updates or similar software in order to perform the repair efforts. Only if DR. GARBAGE's efforts to remedy an error have been unsuccessful twice in succession, you may withdraw from this EULA, reduce the compensation accordingly or claim damages for breach of warranty as set forth in Section 7.\n\n6.5 This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Furthermore, DR. GARBAGE takes no warranty obligations at all for your or third parties' repair efforts or for the test suites and applications developed assisted by the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. \n\n6.6 NO OTHER WARRANTIES. DR. GARBAGE disclaims all other warranties, either express or implied and does not make any representations or guarantees of any kind. \n\n7 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n7.1 Damages resulting from DR. GARBAGE's breach of warranty, breach of contract or from any tort claim are excluded, unless DR. GARBAGE's conduct, also on part of its employees, was intentional or grossly negligent. This restriction, however, does not apply to DR. GARBAGE's essential contractual obligations.\n\n7.2 Your damages claims shall be limited to the amount of five times the compensation paid by you according to Section 4. DR. GARBAGE's liability for your loss of data shall be restricted to the typical expenses for restoration of such data that you would have incurred in the regular production of back-up copies and the risks associated with such production. Liability for unforeseeable damages or for consequential harm caused by a defect in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is excluded, unless such liability results from DR. GARBAGE's intentional conduct.\n\n7.3. The limitation of liability as set forth in Section 7.1 does not apply to to personal injuries and to any liability resulting from DR. GARBAGE's breach of a guarantee or resulting from the German Product Liability Act (ProdHG).\n\n8 CHOICE OF LAW AND JURISDICTION\n\n8.1 This EULA shall be governed by and construed under the laws of Germany as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Germany between German or EU residents. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention in Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the German International Private Law are specifically excluded from application to this EULA.\n\n8.2 The parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of and waive any venue objections against, the Landgericht Berlin, Germany, in any litigation arising out of this EULA. \n\n
