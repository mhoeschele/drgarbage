Control flow graphs generated by [Control Flow Graph Factory][cfgf] are directed and unordered graphs
or digraphs. 

The tree isomorphism is one of crucial task to determine how trees are similar to each other. These problems are used in variety areas of
computer science, because many complicated structures can be transformed into trees and be compared. The Dr. Garbage tools allow to see visually
which branches look same between two logical trees. 

The maximum common subtree isomorphism task consists in finding of largest common subtree between two trees.
The trees can be derived either using Dr. Garbage graphical interface of graph development or extracted from byte/source code.

Control Flow Graph Factory Comparison offers 2 options to investigate similarity between two trees graphically:

* [Top-Down MaxCommon subtree algorithm](#tda)
* [Bottom-Up MaxCommon subtree algorithm](#bua)


Top-Down MaxCommon Subtree Comparision  <a name="tda"></a>
--------------
The algorithm is based to find a maximum common subtree between two different trees starting from root. The largest common subtree that can be found is green highlighted.

Bottom-Up MaxCommon Subtree Comparision  <a name="bua"></a>
----------------

The algorithm is constructed by such way, that the maximum common subtree is being searched starting from the leaves. The maximum similar subtree from the bottom is green highlighted.

How to compare graphs <a name="how"></a>
--------------

Two control-flow graphs can be compared by selected two of them and clicking "Compare with: Each other".
