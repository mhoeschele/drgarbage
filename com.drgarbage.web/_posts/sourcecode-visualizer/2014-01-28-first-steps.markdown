1. Open the Sourcecode Visualizer for the first time
----------------------------------------------------

You can do this through right-clicking a \*.java file in e.g. Package Explorer, *right*-clicking the file and selecting

`Open With > Sourcecode Visualizer`

![open sourcecode visualizer]({{ site.imgurl }}{{ page.url }}openwithsv.png)




2. Review and adjust preferences
--------------------------------

The behaviouur of Sourcecode Visualizer is adjustable in many respects, such as:

* where the control flow graph should be displayed: split pane in the editor or separate view
* syntax highlighting

Just go to

`Window > Preferences > Dr. Garbage > Bytecode Visualizer`

And change the settings to suit your needs.
